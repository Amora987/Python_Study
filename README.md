# Python_Crash_Course

After studying Fin-Tech at SMU, I'm continuing my education in programming. <br>
As a result I decided to review the basics to establish a strong foundation. <br>
I'll start by going through the entire book "Python Crash Course" to reinforce <br> 
my knowledge. Everything in this folder are my notes, I don't own the material <br> 
its just for personal study.
