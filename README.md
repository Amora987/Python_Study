# Python_Crash_Course

After studying Fin-Tech at SMU, I want to continue my education in programming. <br>
As a result I decided to review the basics to establish a strong foundation. <br>
I'll start by going through the entire book "Python Crash Course".

## - Chapter 2
Chapter 2 discussed 
- working with variables, to use descriptive variable names <br> and how to resolve name and syntax errors.
- What strings are and how to display strings using lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase. <br>
- Using whitespace to organize as well as removing unneeded whitespace from parts of strings.<br>
- Working with integers and floats.
